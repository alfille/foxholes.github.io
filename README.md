# Foxholes

Try out a game sent to me by my friend DSK:

## Quick link:

## Summary

This program is a way to test strategies.

The game is the catch a sleeping fox who wakes at night and moves to an adjacent hole. The fox moves one hole in either direction (but not past either end). You can look in one hole each day to see if you found the fox.

## Schr√∂dinger's fox

The program shows a [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat) of all the positions the fox could be hiding. Your checking of the holes helps collapse the possibilities.

## Screenshots

You can change the number of foxholes to add interest.

Showing probabilities shows the chance that a randomly placed and randomly moving fox is in this hole. The sum is the chance you didn't find the fox.

You actually play the game by choosing to inspect a hole (one of the "?" buttons).

The next row shows where the uncaught foxes could move to.

## What's next?

If __Foxholes__ is too easy, try [Doublefox](https://alfille.github.io/doublefox.github.io/) where the holes are arranged in a continuous circle.

## Platform

Pure *Javascript* in any (modern) browser.

The program runs locally (in your browser) so should use negligible bandwidth. No advertising.

Foxholes runs from local cache, but checks (if connected) for updates.
