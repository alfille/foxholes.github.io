# Foxholes

This is a way to try out a game sent to me by my friend DSK.

## Quick link:
[Try Foxholes online now](https://alfille.github.io/foxholes.github.io/)

## Summary

This program is a way to test strategies.

The game is the catch a fox who must between your moves. The fox moves one hole in either direction (but not past either end).

## Schr√∂dinger's fox

The program shows a [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat) of all the positions the fox could be hiding. Your checking of the holes helps collapse the possibilities.

## Screenshots

You can change the number of foxholes to add interest.

Choosing probabilities adds the chance that a randomly placed and moving fox is in this hole (after you tried to catch them).

You actually play the game by choosing to inspect a hole (one of the "?" buttons).

The next row shows where the uncaught foxes could move to.

## What's next?

If __Foxholes__ is too easy, try [Doublefox](https://alfille.github.io/doublefox.github.io/) where the fox can jump to the other side, but you get to inspect 2 holes each time.
